#HomeWork 2 
 1. Write a function (root* node(isEmpty int) that receives a pointer to the root of a binary tree,
and checks whether the tree is empty.
The function returns a value of 1 if the tree is empty, and 0 otherwise

2. Write a function (root* node(printLeaves void) that prints all the leaves in the tree.
The leaves should be printed from left to right with a single space between them.

3. A key The key of the checking mother int contains(node* root, int key) write a function                                                                                                                 
	in a binary tree.
	If key appears in the tree, the function will return a value of 1
	If key does not appear in the tree - the function will return 0.

4. Write a function (root* node(countNodes int) to calculate the total amount of nodes in the tree.
For example: for the tree from wish 2 the function returns 12.


5. Write a function (root* node(sumOfKeys int) that calculates and returns the sum of the node values
of a binary tree.
For example: for the tree from question 2 or for the tree from question 6 (in both questions the same tree was presented)
The function returns 319

6. Write a function void levelStatistics(node* root, int level)
  Prints keys of all the nodes that belong to the level and also calculates and returns the number of nodes in the level


7. Write a function (root* node(isPerfect int) that checks whether a tree is a perfect tree.)
If the tree is paid, the function will return 1, otherwise it will return 0.
